This is the collection of commands run to upgrade Django

# This will upgrade django from 1.5 to 1.8
sudo ./scipion run pip install Django --upgrade

# A second time will upgrade to 1.10.1
sudo ./scipion run pip install Django --upgrade

# Migrate
./scipion run python manage.py migrate


# While getting this error
InvalidTemplateLibrary at /webtools/
Invalid template library specified. ImportError raised when trying to load 'django.templatetags.future': cannot import name ssi
#I've run:
find /home/pablo/desarrollo/scipion-web/software/lib/python2.7/site-packages/django/ -name '*.pyc' -delete

It didn't work.

I've seen this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38931998/django-upgrade-1-9-1-10-error-with-removedindjango110warning-import

So now I've removed django and installed 1.10 using pip withing intelliJ.

It didn't work:
Now I delete django: rm -rf site-packages/django

Basically check with scipion run pip list if django is installed

Test with:
scipion run python
import django
print django.get_version()

Use pip to uninstall and install django 1.10 if required.
