			<p>Upload and import your movies by clicking on the <strong>import movies</strong> box. Finally press "Execute"!
			<p>In order to upload your movies to our server, you have 2 options: a traditional, simple, resumable <strong>file upload</strong> or a more
				technical <strong>rsync</strong> command line from a terminal window.

				Note that this Portal may run in two configurations: Guest/Demo and as an Instruct Access Project.
				In a Guest/Demo configuration, we limit the size of your total set of uploaded movies to 25 GigaBytes
				(this mode is intended to provide just with a quick look on the Web Portal capabilities).
				As an Instruct Access Project, I2PC staff should have already taken care of the correct uploading of
				your movies.
